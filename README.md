# Liri-Node-App

Liri is a language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies

**What does Liri Bot do?**

You have three commands to ask Liri Bot;

1. concert-this [musician's name] will ask Liri to tell you when and where the next concert will be held.
1. spotify-this-song [song name] will ask Liri to tell you who sang the song, which album it's on, and provide the url for you on spotify
1. movie-this [movie title] will ask Liri to give you lots of information including the movie title, year of release, rating, country of origin, language, plot, and actors.

**Usefulness**

Liri Bot is useful to perform a few actions to help the user find information as listed above. This is a language recognition tool similar to a google search, but with specific information it returns to the user.

**Getting started**

Simply type into the terminal "node liri.js" and then your command and the name of what you are looking for. Wait a moment and you'll get all of the information you need to impress your friends.
